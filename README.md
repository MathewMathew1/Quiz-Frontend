# About Project:
React used for frontend.   
Project inspired by https://globalquiz.org/pl/.  
User can anwser/add questions.  
View their states in category.  
View how other people anwser to each question.  
User can edit/delete their questions with option to drop user anwesers data(for example when question was at beginning).  
Questions can be added categories tags from either already established categories or to new once.  
New category will be shown after atleast questions will be added to said category.
One of my first projects with React and fullstack overall. So parts of code are messy
